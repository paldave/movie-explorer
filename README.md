## Project Archived :exclamation:

- Lack of Redux Toolkit
- Better structure

## TMEX (The Movie Explorer)

React and Redux application to browse Movies, TV shows and Actors.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with npm)
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)

## Installation and Running

```
git clone https://github.com/paldave/movie-explorer
npm install
npm start
```

## Things to consider

- [ ] :exclamation: Rewrite project structure to use [Ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux).
  It's going to be much easier to develop new features in a long run;
- [ ] User Profile page and corresponding actions (including collections);
  Unfortunately for now, TMDB API is not providing endpoints for adding new reviews;
